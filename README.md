This is a full stack application, similar to Trello. The frontend part is made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and the server is written with [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/).

## Getting Started

Launching the client development part:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Launching the server development part:

```bash
npm run start:dev
# or
yarn start:dev
# or
pnpm start:dev
# or
bun start:dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. The server will be running on [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
